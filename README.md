Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on the applicant‚Äôs personal and financial information. Using supervised machine learning techniques, the model analyzes historical loan data to understand patterns and factors that influence loan approval decisions.

üß† Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and relationships.
Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding effectively.
Trains multiple classification models to predict loan approval.
Evaluates performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


üìä Dataset

The dataset contains details of loan applicants, including:

ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome
LoanAmount and Loan_Amount_Term
Credit_History
Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed
Property_Area
Loan_Status (Target variable)

The dataset used for this project is similar to the publicly available Loan Prediction dataset from platforms like Kaggle.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Involved

Data Loading and Cleaning

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
Treated outliers and ensured proper data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized relationships between independent features and the target variable.
Explored income distribution, loan amount patterns, and credit history impacts.

Feature Engineering:-

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding.
Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.

Model Building:-

Implemented multiple models such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize results.

Model Evaluation:-

Evaluated models using metrics like:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
